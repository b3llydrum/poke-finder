future features for poke-finder





'Catch all on page' button

	- two buttons:
		- 'catch all on page' pokeball that is toggled between translucent and opaque
		- 'undo' button that reverts 'catch all' / 'release all' to previous state
		- as soon as 'catch all on page' pokeball is selected, if flag is set to 0, poke-finder stores caught pokemon for 'undo' button before catching / releasing all of them -- once. Refreshing the page flushes this cache and resets the flag
		- 

	- generate one sql query into which php implants all the names of the pokemon on the page
	- clicking the button does the following:
		- push current state of pokemon in user_pokemon WHERE (username = $_SESSION['username']) to list for 'undo' option
		- if button is faded, clicking does:
			- place all pokemon on page into user_pokemon WHERE (username = $_SESSION['username']);
			- make button opaque
		- if button is opaque, clicking does:
			- delete all pokemon on page from user_pokemon WHERE (username = $_SESSION['username']);
			- make button undo symbol
		- animate button
		- collect all the names on the page into list		
		- for each item in the list that's not the last one,
			- implant item into sql query + ' OR '
		- else
			- implant item into sql query
		- ajax call code that does the above generation
		- ajax call the actual query

	- this would mean an extra column in a table
	- and an extra search parameter
	- and changing the criteria for php table generation
