	<p>Welcome! Poke-Finder is your companion for catching them all. This is to be used with all generations of Pokemon, from Red and Blue all the way up to Sun and Moon (releasing November 18th, 2016).</p>
	<p>By signing up, you are creating an account for keeping track of all the Pokemon you've caught in your current game. As it stands, every account keeps track of one game-- you'll have to create a new account for a new game file. Your account password is hashed (encoded) and kept in a private server.</p>
	<p>Poke-Finder is free, open source (github.com/b3llydrum/poke-finder), and open to input. Please contact me on reddit (/u/b3llydrum) or email (davidmaness1990 at gmail dot com) if you have any suggestions on features you'd like to see implemented.</p>
	<p>If you are a developer and are interested in joining the Poke-Finder team, please contact me! I am in need of helpers in order to continue improving this app. You must know PHP, basic web design, jQuery, AJAX, and possibly SQL. With everything else, I'll help fill in the gaps.</p>
	<p>Thanks for using Poke-Finder! With feedback, I plan on making this the best companion for completing your National Dex. Let's make this awesome together!</p>
